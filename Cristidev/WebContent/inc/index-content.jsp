			<p>	It's a question, regarding internet privacy.</p>
			<p>It's more, an experiment about just how much a site can gather on a simple browse.</p>
			<p>This website is gonna try and catch as much data as it can about you the end-user 
			and throw it in a database.</p>
			<p>Yeah, I'm gonna show you the things I gather.  Hopefully, it will educate us more on the web.</p>

		<p>We send information about everything involuntary through the internet, so between our searches, 
			likes, and tweets assumes that in those google, facebook and tweeter apps everything is deeply recorded. </p> 
			 
		<p>Third party cookies, flash content, etc are just some of the ways that they are liable to
		  moral debate. Way easier for someone with some IT background to circumvent en-masse for-profit
		  surveillance but the large majority I assume 90% users barely know what a cookie, protocol or
		  database is. Even more ridiculous is that over 50% just stupidly click wizards and check to 
		  accept by habit and without too much understanding.</p>
		 
		 <p>You can't sue Microsoft if u don't have original windows no matter who installs it. 
			 You have one when u buy it for about 100$ or are given OEM by the company that sells 
			 the computer. ANYTHING else means it is not legally acquired and u can be sued by the company 
			 if ever presented to the law, further it just means that they can do largely whatever.  </p>
		 
		 <p>Again not a problem for me or you if any authority may have the legal right to check ur
			  machine with a court order it actually may prevent evil doers from using efficient means,
			   if the police does it you are gonna know about it and have the power to seek justice, but
			    if the private sector does it every time without any regard :D...</p>
			    
		  <p>I am gonna explore some of the ways that I can gather info about you just by visiting
			  the site no third party cookies or others. And btw I'm not a bad guy :D  and zombie cookies exist.</p>
